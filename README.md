# Introduction

## "_<mark style="color:blue;">To have fully configurable, standards-based, inter-operable and widely supported digital CRVS public goods to assure long-term cost savings for governments, partners, and UNICEF- supported digital CRVS deployments."</mark>_

### Background

This work grew out of the UNICEF's focus on evaluation [Electronic Civil Registration and Vital Statistic (eCRVS)](readme/glossary.md) solutions. These evaluations are crucial for understanding the impact and effectiveness of eCRVS implementations. UNICEF advocates for these evaluations to be systematically scaled up, ensuring that they are comprehensive and can be applied across various sectors such as WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene), nutrition, and health. By doing so, UNICEF aims to create a robust framework for assessing the value and functionality of eCRVS systems in diverse contexts.

Furthermore, UNICEF emphasizes the need for the results of these evaluations to be openly available to the ICTD4D (Information and Communication Technology for Development) community. This openness will facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration, helping to drive innovation and improvement in eCRVS and related systems. Making evaluation findings accessible ensures that best practices and lessons learned can be disseminated widely, benefiting a broad range of development initiatives and enhancing the overall impact of eCRVS systems in improving public service delivery and governance.

### Advocating and Supporting Children through Open Technology

UNICEF is mandated by the United Nations General Assembly to advocate for the protection of children's rights, meet their basic needs, and expand their opportunities to reach their full potential. Operating in 190 countries and territories, UNICEF is dedicated to reaching the world's most disadvantaged children, working tirelessly to save the lives of children and their mothers while generating evidence to support this mission. Central to this effort is ensuring that every child is recognized legally, with birth registration being a fundamental right enshrined in both the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.&#x20;

### _<mark style="color:blue;">Birth registration not only establishes a child’s legal identity but also ensures access to essential services such as child protection, healthcare, and education, which are critical for securing their fundamental rights.</mark>_

Efficient civil registration, encompassing births, deaths, marriages, and divorces, provides accurate and complete data essential for national planning and resource allocation. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 16.9, emphasize the importance of providing legal identity for all by 2030. The United Nations Legal Identity Agenda 2020-2030 supports this goal, advocating for sustainable civil registration, vital statistics, and identity management systems.&#x20;

UNICEF, along with other agencies, has been instrumental in advancing the digitization of CRVS systems, aiming for comprehensive and interoperable digital public goods. This initiative, divided into two phases, involved a global landscape analysis and a technical quality assessment to ensure effective and secure implementation. The ultimate goal is to achieve 100% registration of CRVS events, facilitating legal identity documentation and the use of vital statistics for effective planning and international reporting.\


### Two Phase Evaluation Process

•	Phase 1 - Global Landscape Analysis

As outcome of phase 1, a comparative analysis has been made of the different solutions available on the market. Among them, a recommended solution has been identified as well as a set of common and country specific CRVS requirements.\
\
•	Phase 2 – Technical quality assessment of the recommended solutions

During phase 1, a deep comparative functional and maturity analysis of the different solutions has been performed, however, only a superficial technical assessment from the software engineering and cyber security best practices has been done. In phase 2, the goal is to close this knowledge gap for the recommended solutions, and therefore, to minimize the organizational risk under implementation.

•	Phase 2 – Sharing best practices built on technical quality assessements

In addition, with the goal of being able to replicate and scale up this technical evaluation, this phase also entails the definition some practical and actionable technical documents based on the existing best practices for the UNICEF's product lifecycle management that will help the organization to perform this analysis in a systematic way.

<mark style="color:blue;">**THIS is the result of the Phase 2 work - the creation of the Holistic Audit process.**</mark>

### Designing Holistic Audits

To do this, a holistic audit process was designed and implemented. The wide-ranging, [multi-staged approach](process/an-iterative-process.md) includes an [initial assessment](process/audit-components-steps-and-timeline/) based on [published documentation and resources](process/audit-components-steps-and-timeline/assets-for-review/), [meetings and interviews with program staff](people/foundations.md), an [application architecture review](process/audit-components-steps-and-timeline/application-architecture.md), a [source code security audit](process/audit-components-steps-and-timeline/source-code-security.md), a [DevSecOps deployment analysis](process/audit-components-steps-and-timeline/devsecops.md), [vulnerability scanning](process/audit-components-steps-and-timeline/vulnerability-scanning.md) and [penetration testing](process/audit-components-steps-and-timeline/penetration-testing/). Four audit evaluations were completed, and the lessons learned from that work, have been extracted and integrated here into this guide.

### Sharing the Approach

This collection of documents represents a set of perspectives, experiences, and guidelines on engaging with technology within the [Information and Communications Technology for Development (ICT4D)](https://www.unicef.org/topics/information-and-communication-technology) space. In particular, the work focuses on the benefits and impacts of adopting free and open-source software that is secure and privacy-focused.&#x20;

This approach will be discussed through the four lenses of [People, Process, Technology and Partners](perspectives-in-four-ways.md).

### Something For You

While there are some more thoughts on [Who We Aim To Help](readme/who-we-aim-to-help.md), in summary this guide has been created to assist anyone in the ICT4D space who as encountered the question **"Has it been audited?"**, and wondered if that was a financial question or a technology question. Whether you are a procurement specialist, a regional specialist, a technologists for development, or in a program or sales role, this guide has something for you. If you are in charge the audit, or just trying to understand what kind of questions to ask about during an evaluation, this guide has something for you. If you are a vendor, a platform developer, an entrepreneur, an open-source developer, this guide has something for you.
