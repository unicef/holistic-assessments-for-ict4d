    "text": "‚ÄúThe Open Platform‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\nThis solution is an ‚Äúopen platform‚Äù in that it provides a foundation for almost any kind of health and data application to be built upon. The work to be done is NOT ONLY configuration and deployment, but also customization and software development. However, there is also an ecosystem of third-party solutions and vendors that can be utilized to build a complete solution.\nüïµÔ∏èThe Assessment Outcome\nWe found this solution to be stable and ready for implementation. It is a free, open-source software platform designed for reporting, collecting, analyzing, and disseminating individual-level and aggregated data. Although not specifically designed for the specific area of function we were assessing (Civil Registration and Vital Statistics or CRVS), it can integrate with many systems or be extended to include custom features and applications. Implementing interoperability can be costly in terms of both initial integration and long-term operation and maintenance. We also assessed the additional costs associated with combining this software with an external system.\nThe software, provided as a global public good to support sustainable development goals, includes a suite of visualization and analysis tools, making it effective for linking data for reporting and tracking purposes. It can be hosted locally on various devices or in the cloud and is most commonly used for health data. It integrates with various other software and tools through its Application Programming Interface (API) and is deployed in 75 low- and middle-income countries, with over 100 NGOs having implemented it. \n\nThe solution fits many contexts and use cases, such as logistics, education, COVID-19 vaccine tracking, agriculture projects, e-governance, food and nutrition, and more. \n\nOur assessment involved reviewing publicly available documentation, attending virtual meetings, leveraging resources on YouTube and their community resources page, and testing a local cluster using the command line tool. We deployed an instance to test vulnerabilities and dependencies, created a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for the codebase, audited the architecture deployed in AWS, and conducted various vulnerability scans and penetration tests. Despite some scheduling difficulties, the team has been responsive and engaged, providing feedback and clarity.\nüîç Discovered during the Assessment:\nThe solution is highly adaptable, and capable of being customized to suit a variety of use cases. Its extensive configurability and the developers‚Äô efforts in adding multiple extension points for new functionalities suggest it could be effectively transformed into a robust CRVS system. However, this specific functionality is not currently available and would need to be developed before the system could be adopted for CRVS purposes. Our assessment uncovered a number of security enhancements which would be strongly recommended if adopted.\nüñç Recommendations & Actions: \nWith such an adaptable solution, any implementing partner must think critically about the user workflows and roles before adoption, ensuring the solution fits their contextual needs. Ongoing cost considerations, as well as implementing an interoperable solution, will require significant technical and financial resources coupled with updated documentation. Finally, security remains a critical component of any adopted CRVS system. Therefore, a set of recommendations for strengthening infrastructure and source code were provided. Some fixes have been implemented and recommendations were received warmly.",

The work to be done is in configuration and deployment, and not in customization or software development.\nüïµÔ∏èThe Assessment Outcome\nWe found this solution to be stable and ready for implementation. It has excellent documentation for implementers, is interoperable with many e-government solutions, and focuses on real-world workflows with a supportive team. The reliance on third-party dependencies is commonplace, and the choice of microservices makes for a flexible and extensible solution. While there are areas for improvement outlined in the document, they do not detract from the overall positive assessment. \nAs a relatively new entrant to the market, the product may not be as flexible or feature-rich as other solutions but benefits from a focused functionality, modern architecture, and well-run public open-source project. The concept of a single unified upstream codebase that can be improved and updated, then pushed out to downstream instances, is particularly attractive and beneficial for global deployment and maintenance.\nüîç Discovered during the Assessment: \nDuring the first assessment, we encountered vulnerabilities within the source code, the version of nodeJS it is built upon, and the security of deployment configurations. These issues were expected at this stage of the project. \nüñç Recommendations & Actions: \nFixes were implemented, nodeJS was updated, and deployment configurations were improved, indicating a healthy project ready to face real-world challenges. Despite these positive developments, we have concerns about improving the documentation to enable self-service deployment. To scale up effectively, it is essential to ensure the solution can be deployed in a repeatable, reliable, private, and secure manner by qualified individuals. The commitment to open, quality documentation is evident, but some confusing aspects need to be clarified, additional pieces provided, and improved scripts and deployment tools developed.\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised by how engaged and positive the team was in reviewing and addressing these issues.",

This is the most flexible solution and most appropriate for very specific, unique, or niche use cases. The work to be done is to design and develop a new application that integrates these core features. From there, it can be tested, audited, and otherwise prepared to be deployed into production. \nüïµÔ∏èThe Assessment Outcome\nThis assessment provided a detailed analysis of a legal identity system and software development kit designed to enhance civil registration services. The solution was adaptable to various government systems such as voter registration and passports, has been successfully implemented in countries like Malawi and Honduras, facilitating millions of ID card distributions and supporting government services. Despite its versatility and potential, the system required significant technical expertise for successful deployment and maintenance, addressing complex workflows and ensuring interoperability with other registries.\nüîç Discovered during the Assessment:\nThe review highlighted the system‚Äôs microservices architecture, along with client applications for Windows and Android. However, concerns were raised about the limited human capacity for post-deployment maintenance, the lack of integration into an ongoing software lifecycle, and several security vulnerabilities. \n\nIssues identified included hard-coded credentials, inadequate testing, and insufficient defenses against supply chain attacks. \n\nüñç Recommendations & Actions: \nRecommendations for improvement include developing manual and automated test plans, removing hard-coded credentials, and enhancing database access safety. The report also noted challenges in accessing publicly available code and documentation, emphasizing the need for direct partnership with the project team for a secure and successful implementation.",

    "text": "Managing Risk at Scale\n{% hint style=‚Äúsuccess‚Äù %} Most relevant for üí≠ Visionaries and üî• Advisors {% endhint %}\n\nSuccess is dependent upon comprehensive understanding of user needs, threat models and system architectures available within the context of the target beneficiary communities.\n\nWhile many organizations who work in the privacy and security field we are considered to be a part of might balk at the idea of a government deploying a ‚Äú100 per cent continuous, compulsory, and permanent registration‚Äù through digital identity or vital statistics tracking, we do not. Through our deep experience with exile communities, diasporas, refugees, and other communities in great need of services, but lacking core infrastructure and sufficient centralized services, we understand the clear values and benefits that a unified, managed identity service can provide. The challenge then is ensuring it is designed correctly, implemented appropriately, operated securely, and maintained effectively. This challenge is whether to unify a solution into a single, silo‚Äôd monoculture, or to embrace a more diverse, federated approach.\n\nAvoiding Monoculture Pitfalls\nWith the goal of creating a standardized solution that can be easily replicated, an additional burden is added. Any flaw, weakness, or vulnerability in the core implementation, resulting templates and technical recommendation documents, then makes its way into subsequent implementations. Cost savings and standardization are valuable, yes, but in other cases diversity of implementations around a common standard or API can be better than one homogenous monoculture. \nAny audit or assessment must not only consider problems that may arise from one instance with one codebase, but also from 20 or 200 instances, in aggregate, sharing that codebase. This also includes not just the cost, time, and skill of deployment, but also maintenance over time, and handling of emergency situations, patching of vulnerabilities, defending against denial of service attacks, and other common cyber security threats.\n\n\nPackaging Success\nReturning to our deep experience working with communities at risk, especially those facing advanced cyber attacks, we see great value in providing robust, packaged, vetted solutions. This package should also include technical assistance through helpful documentation and best practices forms. This allows the communities themselves to understand how to adopt, nurture, support, and sustain these systems, all while building up their own in-house and local capacity.\nIt is in this aspect that the helpful diversity returns - each organization and local deployment team understands their own unique threats, constraints, vulnerabilities, and requirements that they must tune the deployment for, while still benefiting from the core reusable package."

    "text": "Most relevant for üîç Technical Evaluators\nThe insights below on how best to protect and secure data, inputs, and actions through source code development best practices, were aggregated from the results of the 4 holistic assessments on partner solutions performed as part of this process.\n\n\nSource code can lack measures to mitigate supply chain attacks, such as using tools to control access to dependencies. Supply chain attacks occur when an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the supply chain network to gain unauthorized access to systems or data. One common entry point for such attacks in software development is through external libraries or dependencies that the software relies on. This could happen if dependencies are automatically updated to compromised versions without prior security checks or if dependencies are sourced from unverified or insecure repositories.\nEffective mitigation strategies could include implementing tools that enforce strict version control and dependency review (SBOM!) processes. These tools can automate the tracking of each dependency‚Äôs origin, monitor its integrity, and ensure that it has not been tampered with before integration into the main codebase. Setting up a secure, curated list of approved libraries and enforcing digital signatures for any code changes or updates can further protect against such attacks. These measures not only prevent unauthorized access but also help in maintaining a clean, secure development environment. \n\n\n\nThe lack of sufficient input sanitization in some query mechanisms significantly heightens the risk of SQL injection attacks, a critical security vulnerability in database-driven applications. SQL injection involves the insertion of malicious SQL statements into an entry field for execution, typically with the intent to manipulate or exploit the database. When query inputs are not properly sanitized, these malicious inputs can bypass security mechanisms, allowing attackers to access, modify, or delete data, potentially exposing sensitive information or corrupting the database contents.\nSanitizing inputs involves checking, cleaning, and confirming that each input adheres strictly to the expected format, thus preventing any part of the input from being interpreted as SQL code. Implementing parameterized queries is one effective method of sanitization, where SQL code is defined first and user inputs are then passed as parameters, never as raw SQL code. Additionally, employing web application firewalls (WAFs) and regular security audits can further shield databases from SQL injection attacks by detecting and mitigating possible injection attempts and vulnerabilities. \n\n\n\nThe presence of hard-coded credentials, whether passwords or API keys, within source code or configuration files presents a serious security risk, as it compromises the integrity and confidentiality of the system. They can easily be extracted by malicious actors, especially if the code is exposed or leaked. This practice creates a vulnerability point that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to systems, databases, or network devices, bypassing security mechanisms designed to protect sensitive data and operations.\nInstead, credentials should be stored in secure, encrypted configuration files or secure vaults that are accessed dynamically by the application at runtime. Additionally, the use of environment variables to manage credentials securely outside the application‚Äôs codebase can also be an effective strategy. These measures not only help in safeguarding access to the system but also facilitate easier management of credentials, such as updates or revocations, without the need to modify the source code directly. \n\n\n\nThe improper configuration of exception handling within log auditing systems significantly undermines the effectiveness of security measures, reducing the likelihood of timely detection of intrusions and other critical errors. Log auditing is a fundamental component of cybersecurity, as it provides a historical record of events that can be analyzed to detect anomalous behavior or unauthorized access attempts. \nThis can leave the system vulnerable to continued exploitation without detection, as security teams lack the necessary data to identify and respond to threats effectively. The resolution involves setting up robust logging mechanisms that capture all exceptions, including detailed stack traces and contextual information that can help in diagnosing issues. Furthermore, these logs should be regularly reviewed and analyzed using automated tools that can flag unusual patterns or signs of potential security incidents. Implementing such practices not only aids in the early detection of issues but also helps in maintaining system integrity and availability by enabling prompt and informed responses to various operational and security challenges.\n\n\n\nLogging directly into a database instead of using a dedicated, append-only microservice for log management can introduce significant security vulnerabilities, particularly if attackers gain write access to the database. In such scenarios, the integrity of the logs is compromised as malicious actors could alter or delete logs to cover their tracks, making it difficult to trace unauthorized actions or breaches. This approach lacks the robustness of an immutable logging system where once data is entered, it cannot be changed, ensuring a higher degree of accountability and traceability. \nTo address this vulnerability, implementing an append-only microservice for handling logs can significantly enhance security. This method ensures that logs are stored in a manner where they cannot be altered or deleted once written. Such a microservice acts as a protective layer that isolates log data from the operational databases and enforces strict controls on how log data is handled and accessed. Moreover, using a microservice for logging can also improve scalability and performance by offloading the data-intensive task of log management from the main database, allowing both systems to operate more efficiently. Integrating comprehensive logging practices with robust access controls and regular audits can further solidify the security framework, ensuring that the logs remain an accurate and reliable source of information for detecting and investigating security incidents.\n\n\n\nDirectly accessing the database of an authentication server rather than interfacing through an API as an authentication microservice presents significant security risks. This practice bypasses the layers of security that APIs provide, such as rate limiting, authentication, and encryption, which are designed to protect data integrity and confidentiality. APIs serve as a controlled gateway for data access, ensuring that only valid and authorized requests are processed. \nAdditionally, direct database access can complicate compliance with data protection regulations, which often require stringent data access controls and auditing capabilities that APIs are better equipped to handle. Implementing an API-based microservice architecture would not only enhance security but also improve the scalability and maintainability of the system by clearly defining access protocols and reducing direct dependencies on the database structure.\n\n\n\nThe use of proprietary dependencies in a build configuration can significantly increase the risk of unauthorized access and manipulation, as these dependencies might not undergo the same level of scrutiny and security testing as open-source counterparts. \nMoreover, reliance on proprietary dependencies limits transparency and makes it challenging to perform comprehensive security audits. It is essential for developers to implement strict access controls and continuously monitor these dependencies for any security updates or patches. Additionally, wherever possible, substituting proprietary dependencies with well-supported, open-source alternatives can enhance security by leveraging the broader community for security vetting and faster vulnerability resolution.",

These findings highlight a selection of CRVS platforms. The platforms were selected after due consultations with stakeholders on existing CRVS offerings. Conducted by UNICEF (via a 3rd party vendor), the review assessed the functional and non- functional aspects, as well as maturity, of CRVS products. The scope of this publication has limitations related to a) the exclusion of home-grown solutions and b) reliance on self-reporting by the vendors. This publication is relevant to UN, government, and NGO actors. It is intended to guide planning, budgeting, technology selection, and implementation strategies. It is also intended to support planning and programme operations design that are fit for purpose and uphold value, feasibility, and sustainability principles.\nFull report is available for download in PDF format.\n{% file src=‚Äú../.gitbook/assets/CRVS_Key Findings_for_Practitioners.pdf‚Äù %}\n\n\nIdentifying and Addressing Risks to Children in Digitized Birth Registration Systems\nIncorporating digital technologies in birth registration processes holds important potential for expanding the reach of registration and its benefits. This potential is beginning to be realised in a few countries: birth registration efforts through mobile phones have been linked to increasing registration rates in Uganda, and web-enabled birth registration in Uruguay allows newborns to receive their birth certificates before they leave the hospital.2 As countries expand their e-government capacities, digitised birth registration (DBR) may support governments in fulfilling their responsibility for civil registration and the provision of vital statistics.\nSuccess stems from the ability of digital technology to streamline registration processes and improve data quality, overcoming both the geographic and bureaucratic barriers that often keep registration low. However, as with the introduction of any new technology, there are also potential dangers. These dangers have received little attention to date. To avoid them, implementing government agencies and their partners need to understand the potential\nfor harm related to DBR in general, and how to assess this potential in their specific country context. When the risks are mitigated, the full value and benefits of digital technologies in birth registration can be realised.\nThis document provides guidance on identifying and mitigating these risks for implementing government agencies and their partners operating in low- and middle-income countries. It expands on the model of DBR developed by Plan International as part of its Count Every Child initiative and within the context of strengthening civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems more broadly.\nFull report is available for download in PDF format.\n{% file src=‚Äú../.gitbook/assets/PlanInternationalGeneva_4.pdf‚Äù %}"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Software Bill of Materials\nMost relevant for üîç Technical Evaluators\nSoftware Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a list of all the open source and third-party components present in a codebase. An SBOM also lists the licenses that govern those components, the versions of the components used in the codebase, and their patch status, which allows security teams to quickly identify any associated security or license risks. There a few standardized formats that exist for SBOMs.\n\nProcesses and Tools\nThe adoption of open-source tools (see our resources page for a list of recommended tools) to generate Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) for entire source code repositories and, when feasible, for each Docker image produced from those repositories, marks a significant step in enhancing the transparency and security of the software development process. SBOMs provide a detailed list of all components, libraries, and dependencies used in the software, offering critical insights into the software‚Äôs composition. This documentation is invaluable for tracking the provenance and ensuring the integrity of the software components, facilitating easier management of licenses, vulnerabilities, and compliance with security standards. By generating SBOMs, organizations can quickly identify and respond to security vulnerabilities or licensing issues that may impact their software, thereby improving their overall security posture.\nHere is an example of the kind of output that an SBOM tool can generate, providing detail about the components, versioning, license, and cryptographic hash of a software dependency:\n\n\n\n\nFrom SBOM Example on ScribeSecurity.com\n\n\n\nFurthermore, using a tool specifically for Docker images amplifies these benefits by addressing the unique challenges posed by containerized environments, such as layering and the use of base images that might include additional dependencies. This practice ensures that each layer of the Docker image is analyzed and documented, providing a comprehensive view of what‚Äôs inside the containers. This level of detail is crucial for security teams and developers who need to ensure that no insecure or outdated components are lurking within containers, potentially exposing applications to security threats. The ability to generate SBOMs at both the repository and Docker image level not only streamlines security practices but also enhances operational efficiency by allowing for automated tools to handle much of the vulnerability management workload.\n\n\nIn Case of Proprietary Code‚Ä¶\nWhen engaging with vendors, particularly those who offer proprietary solutions, it is crucial to discuss the possibility of obtaining a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). An SBOM serves as a detailed inventory of all components, libraries, and dependencies used in a product, providing transparency into its technical composition without necessitating the disclosure of proprietary intellectual property. This transparency is vital for assessing potential security vulnerabilities and compliance with licensing regulations. By requesting an SBOM, organizations can gain insight into the underlying architecture of the software they are purchasing, enabling them to make informed decisions about security risks and compatibility with their existing systems. Consequently, SBOMs are becoming a key element in the procurement process, facilitating greater trust and collaboration between buyers and vendors while safeguarding the confidentiality of proprietary technologies.\n\n\nLegal Requirements for SBOMs\nThe United States has taken significant legislative steps to improve cybersecurity, especially in the wake of high-profile cyberattacks like the SolarWinds incident. Executive Order 14028, issued in May 2021, aims to secure software systems used by federal agencies by enhancing the transparency of software supply chains and enforcing several security measures. Among these measures are the requirements for service providers to secure software development environments, maintain trusted source code supply chains, and provide a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for each product. This ensures that all software components, their origins, and any known vulnerabilities are documented, enhancing the ability to monitor and address security risks effectively. While these requirements currently apply to vendors working with the U.S. government, they serve as a best practice framework that can benefit all software vendors by improving security during development and post-deployment.\nSimilarly, the DHS Software Supply Chain Risk Management Act mandates that contractors to the Department of Homeland Security must provide an SBOM for their IT products or services, detailing any known vulnerabilities and mitigation plans. This legislative approach has also been mirrored by the FDA, which has set requirements for medical device manufacturers to provide SBOMs due to increased cyber threats to healthcare institutions. These regulations are part of broader efforts, such as the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, which empowers the FDA to regulate the cybersecurity of medical devices, including requirements for monitoring and addressing post-market vulnerabilities and ensuring devices are free from known risks before they are marketed. Both these examples underscore a growing legislative trend towards mandating the provision of SBOMs to enhance transparency and security in the software supply chain, a practice that is expected to expand further, including potential adoption in the EU through proposed legislation like the Cyber Resilience Act.",

    "text": "Assets for Review\nIn order to fully assess a solution, you need the right set of inputs. The following is a list and description of the recommended assets to requests from any solution provider.\n\nProduct and architecture documents, diagrams, specifications\nThese materials should outline the overall structure and design of the software, showing the interrelationships between various components and layers within the architecture. Diagrams should include both high-level overviews and detailed breakdowns of specific subsystems. Specifications should cover both functional and non-functional requirements of the software, providing clear insight into its intended behavior, performance metrics, security features, and integration capabilities. This documentation will enable us to assess the software‚Äôs design robustness, maintainability, and compliance with best practices and relevant standards.\n\n\nUser stories, personas, threat models, needs assessments, and other user experience and feature design inputs\nTo gain a comprehensive understanding of the user experience and feature design of your software solution, an audit requires all relevant materials that detail user stories, personas, threat models, needs assessments, and other user experience inputs. User stories should describe the functionality of the software from an end-user perspective, illustrating typical tasks and user objectives.\n\n\n\n\nA user story example from Parabol.co\n\n\n\nPersonas should provide detailed profiles of user types, including their goals and challenges, and usage which inform the design and functionality of your product.\n\n\n\n\nPersona example from the Interaction Design Foundation\n\n\n\nThreat models that outline potential security vulnerabilities from a user perspective, including how these threats are mitigated, are also useful. Needs assessments should detail the research conducted to identify what users require from the software, including how these needs have driven the design decisions made. \n\n\nSource code for all tiers of the application\nAccess to all the source code for all tiers of the application, including but not limited to the front-end, back-end, and any middleware or services that interact between these layers, is necessary for a true holistic audit. The solution provider should offer complete, up-to-date source code repositories for each component of the application, preferably with version control histories, if available. This should also include any build scripts, dependencies, and third-party libraries used within the application, along with documentation that describes the build process, environment configuration, and deployment procedures. \n\n\nAccess to ticketing systems, discussion boards, wikis, and other public development infrastructure\nFor a comprehensive understanding of the development process and ongoing maintenance of your software solution, the assessment team should have access to all related development infrastructure. This includes ticketing systems, discussion boards, wikis, and any other platforms used for public development communication and documentation. \n\n\n\n\nDHIS2 has a robust community forum\n\n\n\nAccess to these resources will allow for review of how features and bugs are tracked, prioritized, and resolved, providing insights into a team‚Äôs workflow and responsiveness to issues. Additionally, it is important to examine the collaborative aspects of the development process by looking into how information is shared and decisions are made, as documented in discussion boards and wikis. This review helps to assess the effectiveness of a development practices, the alignment of ongoing work with user needs and security practices, and the overall health and sustainability of the project‚Äôs development environment.\n\n\nInputs to and results from any other security audits\nTo ensure a comprehensive evaluation of a software solution‚Äôs security posture, detailed documentation pertaining to any previous security audits conducted should be requested. This includes both the inputs provided for these audits, such as scopes, specifications, configurations, and any specific areas of concern, as well as the results or findings from the audits, including detailed reports, vulnerability assessments, risk analysis, and recommendations made.\n\n\n\n\nOpenCRVS offers robust and transparent public security information\n\n\n\nAdditionally, any follow-up actions taken or remediations implemented as a result of these audits should also be included. Access to this historical audit information will allow the audit team to gauge the evolution of the software‚Äôs security measures over time, understand recurring issues or vulnerabilities, and evaluate the effectiveness of previous remediation efforts. This will be instrumental in identifying potential areas of vulnerability, assessing risk levels, and recommending further improvements to enhance the software‚Äôs security and compliance with industry standards.\n\n\nPrerequisites for installation, deployment, use, access\nTo ensure the assessment team has a smooth installation, deployment, and usage of the software solution, request detailed documentation outlining all prerequisites and necessary conditions. This documentation should include specific hardware and software requirements, such as operating systems, database systems, third-party libraries, and any necessary software dependencies. Additionally, any guides detailing the installation process, including step-by-step instructions and any scripts or automation tools used, should be provided.\n\n\n\n\nOpenCRVS provides detailed information on dependencies and installation.\n\n\n\nFor deployment, request to have provided configurations, environmental setup details, and best practices to ensure representational and optimal performance and security. Information on access requirements, such as necessary credentials, user role configurations, and security protocols for gaining entry to different parts of the system, should also be included. This information will enable the audit team to replicate a solution‚Äôs deployment environment accurately, ensuring that the holistic technical assessment reflects the real-world operation and integration of the solution.\n\n\nOperational deployment images, tools, and/or scripts for configuration management\nFor a thorough examination of the operational aspects of your software solution, request detailed documentation and actual deployment artifacts including operational deployment images, tools, and scripts used for configuration management. This includes any container images, virtual machine snapshots, or other deployable artifacts that represent the production or staging environments of the solution. Additionally, request access to the tools and scripts used for managing configurations, deploying updates, and maintaining the infrastructure. This should include automation scripts for provisioning, deployment scripts, configuration templates, and any relevant documentation that describes how these tools and scripts are used in the daily operations of the application.\nThis information will enable the assessment team to understand the deployment processes, configuration management practices, and operational workflows used to maintain the application. It will also allow them to assess the efficiency, reliability, and security of the deployment and configuration management strategies employed. By replicating the operational environment, the assessment can more accurately identify potential operational vulnerabilities, ensure compliance with industry standards, and suggest improvements to enhance system stability and security.\n{% file src=‚Äú../../../.gitbook/assets/Requested Assets.pdf‚Äù %} List of assets requested from each vendor {% endfile %}",

While fully bespoke and custom security audits are always a valuable service, they come at a very high cost in both money and time. Our approach for this holistic technical assessment was to use tools and techniques that are both within the realm of the available budget, and provided a more dynamic, ongoing approach for uncovering vulnerabilities. We recommend this approach for use not only in the assessment stage, but also as part of the ongoing monitoring in future eCRVS production deployments.\nOpen-Source Software (OSS) vulnerability scanning\nWe used free and open-source tools to check the source and Docker images for vulnerabilities. See the Resourcessection for more information on our tool recommendations. \n\nStatic application security testing (SAST) scanning\nWe used free and open-source tools to perform an automated analysis of the Typescript/Javascript codebase. See the Resourcessection for more information on our tool recommendations. \n\n\nScanning at Runtime\nDynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a type of security testing that focuses on the dynamic analysis of the application while it is running. DAST testing involves analyzing the behavior of the application during runtime to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. DAST tools typically simulate a user interacting with the application, sending various inputs to the system to see how it responds. DAST testing is particularly useful for identifying vulnerabilities related to input validation, authentication, and authorization.\nDAST testing is focused on identifying vulnerabilities that can be discovered by analyzing the running application. DAST tools scan the application for vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQL injection, and CSRF attacks, and typically use a black-box approach where they have no knowledge of the application‚Äôs internal workings. DAST tools can be used to identify a wide range of vulnerabilities, but they may miss some issues that can only be identified through manual testing or other specialized testing techniques.",

Our core values include security, privacy, and transparency, reflected in all our developments.\n\nThe core team of contributors for this work include:\n\nNathan Freitas, Technical Advisor \nTiffany Robertson, Project Manager\nDarren Clarke, Source Code & Application Auditor\nAbel, Source Code & Application Auditor\nIain Learmonth, DevSec Ops Auditor \nPaul Mayero, General Auditor\nCarrie Winfrey, Researcher & Designer\n\nIndependent Auditors:\n\nMikael Von Pfaler, Auditor\nMichael, Auditor\n\n\nRelevant Expertise\nOur work at Oliver+Coady, inc, via Guardian Project, has always been focused on the human rights and humanitarian context, aiming to bend technology to better serve people and communities whose data and digital communications are at higher risk of being exploited and used against them. Over the last 15 years, we have provided security and privacy-focused software architecture, development, and operational deployment services across the human rights and humanitarian technology space. We have experience managing complex multi-year, multi-million dollar technical projects with many stakeholders, and hundreds of thousands to millions of end-users.\nFor over a decade, we have also been heavily involved in open-source software communities, in particular those focused on privacy-enhancing technology, security-by-design and the minimization of tracking by third-parties. We have worked within projects that are part of Debian, Tor Project, Mozilla, Android, and more. We also lead and nurture our own open-source projects and communities, such as Clean Insights, F-Droid, and ProofMode. \nOur DevOps team has worked to define a best-of-breed approach to supporting development and deployment of secure and privacy services protecting high-risk data. We have experience deploying on Amazon Web Services, which is ISO certified for Cloud Security and Data Protection, Microsoft Azure Cloud, Fastly, and other independent hosting providers. For network security purposes, we use private virtual intranets and web application firewalls to secure access to our services. When possible, all content stored is encrypted using cryptographic keys generated using end-to-end encryption protocols, and that are only resident in the user‚Äôs device or browser. We also take a privacy-preserving approach to measurement - in most cases, no full IP addresses are logged by our servers or analytics services, only country level information. Access logs are stored for the minimal amount of time necessary to operate the service, and are not shared with any third-party. All internal and external communications within our team are encrypted (TLS, VPN, SSH, OpenPGP, Signal, Matrix). All of our services require two-factor authentication access with hardware token, from authorised devices.\nImplementation of regular security audits and updates ensure that security standards are upheld. In addition to our own internal auditing and manual and automated testing, we use reputable third-party penetration ‚ÄúRed Team‚Äù testing teams to test the security of our services on an annual basis or after major releases."

We include best practices related to ‚ÄúDeveloper Secure Operations‚Äù (DevSecOps) and Continuous Iteration/Continuous Deployment approaches, and why they can be useful in this context. We also share our approach to ongoing vulnerability assessment and penetration scanning, beyond just a single one time ‚Äúaudit‚Äù. Through this, we aim to provide a set of strategies that can provide confidence and greater understanding of a very complex set of moving pieces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartners\nLastly, in the area of ‚ÄúPartners‚Äù, we share our ideas about what makes a good partner when choosing a technology solution. We discuss both technical acumen, as well as the equally important questions of positive indicators around sustainability, communication, and culture. We share experiences we have had in our own work assessing eCRVS solutions, and how these green or red flags can help you make decisions about which partners, vendors, solutions, and organizations you choose to become dependent upon.",

Where manual systems can be inaccurate and difficult to access, digital systems present the opportunity to streamline the process and improve data integrity and security. With Digital Transformation as a priority, UNICEF has the opportunity to accelerate its mission to protect the wellbeing and rights of children worldwide.\n\n‚ÄúAround the world, over 1 billion people are invisible, living without a legal identity.‚Äù\n\nIn order to undergo Digital Transformation in any sector, partnerships with governments, civil society groups, academia, non-governmental organizations, private sector entities, and communities remain central to UNICEF‚Äôs approach. They create a network to address the complex challenges of Digital Transformation: both social and technical. \nThis network of stakeholders play a vital role in the success of Digital Transformation. This report looks through the lens of CRVS projects to reflect how the interactions between stakeholders affects success. It explores:\n\nWho is involved\nExperiences with government; and\nThreats to success\n\n\nResearch Background\nThis study included five conversations with a variety of stakeholders who have been involved in engagements to implement digital systems or to advise on their expansion. It represents the perspectives of UNICEF staff in regional and country offices who are coordinating and advising governments on digital components of programs. It involved in-depth conversations with a tech solution coordinator who closely works on implementations of CRVS solutions with several governments both with and without UNICEF‚Äôs involvement. Last, but certainly not least, it brings a critical perspective on what it means to localize technology within a country or group of people; and specifically women.\nThe full report is available for download in PDF format. You can also view the Threats to Success executive summary presentation in the following section.",

In our research, we found that there are several different stakeholders involved in Digital Transformation processes, and that they may be unique for each engagement. We categorize stakeholders into five roles:\n\nGovernment\nAdvisory\nTechnology Implementers\nField and Office Workers\nCitizens\n\nThe people within these categories will certainly be different depending on the collaboration in system being built. In each section, we expand on this giving a sense of the different type of people that might be involved in representing that role. The descriptions of stakeholders provided below is informed by stakeholder research done on the Digital Transformation of Vivil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) programs. The full research report is available on the Stakeholder Experiences page.\n\n\nTypically the government takes the lead and is the primary decision maker. They are supported by sponsors, advisors, and technical experts who offer guidance, financial support, and essential services. Different ministries and offices within a government are involved in Digital Transformation projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNICEF Advisors\nTypical way UNICEF advises:\n\n‚ÄúI was there to interface between the government and also the vendor. Then sometimes we will bring our regional colleagues, and we have a discussion about all of the system requirements.‚Äù ‚Äî Country Programme Participant\n\nOther Advisors may also be involved. Outside of UNICEF, other civil organizations and sponsors provide guidance and funding. They include, but are not limited to World Bank, Plan International, Vital Strategies, and UN ESCAP (Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe composition of stakeholders involved in the technology implementation will vary depending on the government‚Äôs approach (ie. building in-house or using outside products and services) and subsequently, their selection of platforms and vendors. For example, if a government is building a system from scratch, they may hire a 3rd party software development team to build it, then move the project to their in-house development team to maintain. Other governments may choose to use a digital public good, like OpenCRVS or DHIS2. If this is their starting point, their process and partners will look very different. \nTechnology stakeholders that may be involved include:\n\nInternal development teams\n3rd party software companies\nImplementation coordinator for the technology platform\nTechnology platform‚Äôs community of developers \nSystem integrator \nEntry-level developers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe individuals responsible for recording the registrations and vital statistics are key stakeholders. These people are unique in each country, but can include nurses, community health workers and tribal chiefs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitizens are a key stakeholder, as the success of a programme is dependent on their involvement. Among those responsible for registration are parents of newborns, immigrants, urban dwellers, as well as families and individuals residing in remote villages or mountainous regions.",

    "text": "An Iterative Process\nMost relevant for üî• Advisors and üîç Technical Evaluators\nAn iterative process is a way of working through a project by repeatedly refining and improving upon it through a series of cycles or iterations. In software development, this process is often used as a way to manage the complexity of creating large, complex software systems. Using an iterative process allows the team to focus on small, manageable chunks of work at a time, which helps to reduce the risk of errors and makes it easier to manage the complexity of the project.\nIt also allows the team to gather feedback from stakeholders and users throughout the process, which can be used to refine and improve the project as it progresses. \n\nCore Guidelines\n\nBe transparent and engaged with all stakeholders through open systems and communication.\nShare results and outputs, early and often for feedback.\nDebrief and reflect upon the quality of outcomes and outputs, to inform, revise, and improve subsequent iterations of the work.\n\n\n\nHow We Engage \nOur process adheres to a series of tasks and engagements outlined in the Assessment Methodologysection, involving the vendor or technology solution team. This approach fosters transparency and ensures the accuracy of the findings we produce and share.\nFurthermore, is important to engage with vendors frequently regarding any discovered vulnerabilities or bugs. After each step in the process we share an update with the vendor and the commissioning team (f.i. it was UNICEF in our case) and allow feedback so the process can be iterative and accurately reflect a relevant and up-to-date solution. \nWe begin with introductions and laying a foundation of communication and trust, which we hope continues throughout the lifecycle of our engagement. \n\n\nBelow are a few examples of how our iterative process involves the vendor or technology solution team in the assessment process: \n\nInitial introduction between assessment team, solution team, and other stakeholders.\nOnboarding call with the vendor and typical guided walk-thru or demo of the solution.\nCreate an established communications channel and share an asset request list with the vendor.\n\nTip: It is helpful to choose a communication channel that already exists in the vendor workflow to ease any burden of communication.\n\n Create a file sharing service folder for ease of document uploading and sharing of Assets and any additional resources the vendor deem useful to successfully complete the process (case studies, security audits, SBOM, independent reports, etc.).\nMaintain transparency throughout the process and communicate regularly. \nOnce technical quality assessments are complete, we value a video call with the vendor or technology solution team to review comments and findings in real-time. Time is then spent incorporating comments and updating our final report.\n\nTip: This step should happen before sharing the full assessment with other stakeholders. \n\n\nFor high or severe level vulnerabilities, the disclosure approach includes: \n\nEthically disclose vulnerabilities or bugs to vendors.\n\nAfter each step you complete in the assessment, disclose any vulnerabilities or bugs found to the vendor through an agreed upon communication channel.\n\nHandle all sensitive communications through a secure, confidential manner agreed upon by the vendor and assessment team.\nNegotiate with vendors regarding the complexity of a fix and timeline.\nBased on the complexity, determine how and when to update the assessment report accordingly (ie- a vulnerability is disclosed, but not fixed, a fix is in process, a resulting evaluation of a fix).",

    "text": "Although this project doesn‚Äôt change the statistic, it focuses on the mindset and holistic approach for technical assessments necessary when considering a new partner for a digital transformation initiative under UNICEF. Our role as independent vendors, was to develop a holistic approach to assessments which can be utilized, replicated and iterated upon by other sectors engaging in a digital transformation initiative.\n\n\nThis work originated from UNICEF‚Äôs focus on reviewing Electronic Civil Registration and Vital Statistic (eCRVS) solutions. These assessments are vital for evaluating the impact and effectiveness of eCRVS implementations. UNICEF aims to systematically scale up these reviews to ensure they are comprehensive and applicable across various sectors, including WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene), nutrition, and health. By doing so, UNICEF seeks to establish a robust framework for assessing the value and functionality of eCRVS systems in diverse contexts. \nFurthermore, UNICEF emphasizes the need for the results of these assessments to be openly available to the ICT4D (Information and Communication Technology for Development) community. This openness will facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration, helping to drive innovation and improvement in eCRVS and related systems. Making assessment findings accessible ensures that best practices and lessons learned can be disseminated widely, benefitting a broad range of development initiatives and enhancing the overall impact of eCRVS systems in improving public service delivery and governance. \n\n\n\nUNICEF is mandated by the United Nations General Assembly to advocate for the protection of children‚Äôs rights, meet their basic needs, and expand their opportunities to reach their full potential. Operating in 190 countries and territories, UNICEF is dedicated to reaching the world‚Äôs most disadvantaged children, working tirelessly to save the lives of children and their mothers while generating evidence to support this mission. Central to this effort is ensuring that every child is recognized legally, with birth registration being a fundamental right enshrined in both the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. \n\n\n\nEfficient civil registration, encompassing births, deaths, marriages, and divorces, provides accurate and complete data essential for national planning and resource allocation. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 16.9, emphasize the importance of providing legal identity for all by 2030. The United Nations Legal Identity Agenda 2020-2030 supports this goal, advocating for sustainable civil registration, vital statistics, and identity management systems. \n\n\n\nUNICEF, along with other agencies, has been instrumental in advancing the digitization of CRVS systems, aiming for comprehensive and interoperable digital public goods.

    "text": "Although this project doesn‚Äôt change the statistic, it focuses on the mindset and holistic approach for technical assessments necessary when considering a new partner for a digital transformation initiative under UNICEF. Our role as independent vendors, was to develop a holistic approach to assessments which can be utilized, replicated and iterated upon by other sectors engaging in a digital transformation initiative.\n\n\nThis work originated from UNICEF‚Äôs focus on reviewing Electronic Civil Registration and Vital Statistic (eCRVS) solutions. These assessments are vital for evaluating the impact and effectiveness of eCRVS implementations. UNICEF aims to systematically scale up these reviews to ensure they are comprehensive and applicable across various sectors, including WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene), nutrition, and health. By doing so, UNICEF seeks to establish a robust framework for assessing the value and functionality of eCRVS systems in diverse contexts. \nFurthermore, UNICEF emphasizes the need for the results of these assessments to be openly available to the ICT4D (Information and Communication Technology for Development) community. This openness will facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration, helping to drive innovation and improvement in eCRVS and related systems. Making assessment findings accessible ensures that best practices and lessons learned can be disseminated widely, benefitting a broad range of development initiatives and enhancing the overall impact of eCRVS systems in improving public service delivery and governance. \n\n\n\nUNICEF is mandated by the United Nations General Assembly to advocate for the protection of children‚Äôs rights, meet their basic needs, and expand their opportunities to reach their full potential. Operating in 190 countries and territories, UNICEF is dedicated to reaching the world‚Äôs most disadvantaged children, working tirelessly to save the lives of children and their mothers while generating evidence to support this mission. Central to this effort is ensuring that every child is recognized legally, with birth registration being a fundamental right enshrined in both the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. \n\n\n\nEfficient civil registration, encompassing births, deaths, marriages, and divorces, provides accurate and complete data essential for national planning and resource allocation. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 16.9, emphasize the importance of providing legal identity for all by 2030. The United Nations Legal Identity Agenda 2020-2030 supports this goal, advocating for sustainable civil registration, vital statistics, and identity management systems. \n\n\n\nUNICEF, along with other agencies, has been instrumental in advancing the digitization of CRVS systems, aiming for comprehensive and interoperable digital public goods. This initiative, divided into two phases, involved a global landscape analysis and a technical quality assessment to ensure effective and secure implementation. The ultimate goal is to achieve 100% registration of CRVS events, facilitating legal identity documentation and the use of vital statistics for effective planning and international reporting. \n\n\n\n\n\n‚Ä¢ Phase 1 - Global Landscape Analysis\nAs outcome of phase 1, a comparative analysis has been made of the different solutions available on the market.

We work at the intersection of human and digital rights alongside communities to find solutions which are secure, protect privacy and fit within community contexts. Our core values include security, privacy, and transparency, reflected in all our developments. \n\n\n\n\nWe are actual humans who care!\n\n\n\nThe core team of contributors for this work include:\n\nNathan Freitas, Project Director and Technical Advisor \nTiffany Robertson, Project Manager\nDarren Clarke, Source Code & Application Architecture Auditor\nAbe Luck, Source Code & Application Architecture Auditor\nIain Learmonth, DevSecOps Auditor \nCarrie Winfrey, Researcher & Designer\n\nIndependent Auditors:\n\nMikael Von Pfaler, Auditor\nMichael Pons, Auditor\nPaul Mayero, Auditor\n\n\nRelevant Expertise\nOur work at has always been focused on the human rights and humanitarian context, aiming to bend technology to better serve people and communities whose data and digital communications are at higher risk of being exploited and used against them. Over the last 15 years, we have provided security and privacy-focused software architecture, development, and operational deployment services across the human rights and humanitarian technology space. We have experience managing complex multi-year, multi-million dollar technical projects with many stakeholders, and hundreds of thousands to millions of end-users.\n\n\nOpen-Source Engagement\nFor over a decade, we have also been heavily involved in open-source software communities, in particular those focused on privacy-enhancing technology, security-by-design and the minimization of tracking by third-parties. We have worked within projects that are part of Debian, Tor Project, Mozilla, Android, and more. We also lead and nurture our own open-source projects and communities, such as Clean Insights, F-Droid, and ProofMode. \n\n\nSecure Development Operations\nOur DevOps team has worked to define a best-of-breed approach to supporting development and deployment of security and privacy services protecting high-risk data. We have experience deploying on Amazon Web Services, which is ISO certified for Cloud Security and Data Protection, Microsoft Azure Cloud, Fastly, and other independent hosting providers. For network security purposes, we use private virtual intranets and web application firewalls to secure access to our services. When possible, all content stored is encrypted using cryptographic keys generated using end-to-end encryption protocols, and that are only resident in the user‚Äôs device or browser. \n\n\nPrivacy-Preserving Measurement and Analytics\nWe also take a privacy-preserving approach to measurement - in most cases, no full IP addresses are logged by our servers or analytics services, only country level information. Access logs are stored for the minimal amount of time necessary to operate the service, and are not shared with any third-party. All internal and external communications within our team are encrypted (TLS, VPN, SSH, OpenPGP, Signal, Matrix). All of our services require two-factor authentication access with hardware token, from authorised devices.\n\n\nSecurity Culture\nImplementation of regular security audits and updates ensure that security standards are upheld. In addition to our own internal auditing and manual and automated testing, we use reputable third-party penetration ‚ÄúRed Team‚Äù testing teams to test the security of our services on an annual basis or after major releases.",

    "text": "Physical Realities\nMost relevant for üîç Technical Evaluators\nWhile many technology startups and services can fully embrace the opaque virtualization of modern cloud service infrastructure, when it comes to personal, private, and health data, and other ICT4D applications, you need to be more careful. Fully considering how and where your infrastructure is hosted, and where physical devices like laptops, tablets, and smartphones will be used is an absolute requirement when launching new technology.\n\n\nSelf-Hosted\n\nIn-Office or ‚ÄúBack Office‚Äù\n\nIn some cases, deploying and managing server infrastructure in a physically secure office setting is the only option. If done right, it can also be a very good option. The most critical piece in this setting is physical security of the hardware, followed by ensuring reliably power and internet. \nThe Assessment 1: The Turn-Key Solution and Assessment 3: The Custom Software Development Kit are examples of solutions that could be run in this kind of setting.\n\nData Center\n\nIf you have the skills and resources to build and run your own data center, then it can be a cost-effective and very secure solution. On top of the considerations from hosting in an office, the physical security of the entire data center room, along with cooling, power, and other physical demands must be considered.\nThe Assessment 2: The Open Platform is an example of a solution that could be run in this kind of setting.\n\n\n\n\nCloud-Hosted\n\nDedicated Servers\n\nBy moving your hosting to a third-party cloud data center, but still using your own physically dedicated servers, you can alleviate some of the risk and load from your team, while still having a large amount of control of your infrastructure. This includes ensuring your server is using full-disk encryption for example.\n\nVirtual Private Servers\n\nThe cheaper approach to cloud hosting is to have multiple virtual servers share one physical server box. This a cost-affordable solution, but also the least private and secure. Any use of a VPN should require data encryption-at-rest within the database and disk volumes.\n\nElastic or On-Demand Infrastructure\n\nBeyond the basic dichotomy of Dedicated vs Virtual, there is a third category of hosting which could be called ‚ÄúElastic‚Äù. This is an approach that allows an image of a service to be created and deployed through automated tools, and for the scale of availability of that infrastructure to be dynamically scaled up and down based on demand and need.\n\n\n\n\nSoftware as a Service (SaaS)\nLetting someone else manage your application in their own data center or cloud infrastructure is definitely the simplest and fastest path to launching. However, you are not only trusting ‚Äúsomeone else‚Äôs computer‚Äù, but you are trusting ‚Äúsomeone else‚Äù with all of your data, reliability, and relationships to the beneficiary. You may also not be able to fully control where your data exists geographically, or ensure it is only stored in legal jurisdictions compatible with your application and beneficiaries expectations.\nThe Assessment 4: The Cloud SaaS is an example of a solution that is offered in this way.",

It may also record marriages and divorces.\n\n\nSoftware Bill of Materials (SBOM)\nList of all the open source and third-party components present in a codebase. An SBOM also lists the licenses that govern those components, the versions of the components used in the codebase, and their patch status, which allows security teams to quickly identify any associated security or license risks.\n\n\nDigital Public Good (DPGs)\nPublic goods in the form of software, data sets, AI models, standards or content that are generally free cultural works and contribute to sustainable national and international digital development designed to service public interest. DPGs are often characterized by their accessibility and affordability. Digital public goods work like digital treasures available for everyone to use and enjoy. Think about a big book library ‚Äî except instead of books, it is packed with digital objects like software, datasets, and useful resources. These belongings are particular in that they‚Äôre priceless and available for all to utilize. Several international agencies, including UNICEF and UNDP, are exploring DPGs as a possible solution to address the issue of digital inclusion, particularly for children in emerging economies. Visit https://digitalprinciples.org/ for more information. \n\n\nPenetration Test (Pen Test)\nAn authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system. The test is performed to identify weaknesses (also referred to as vulnerabilities), including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system‚Äôs features and data, as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed.\n\n\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)\nA weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Mitigation of the vulnerabilities in this context typically involves coding changes, but could also include specification changes or even specification deprecations (e.g., removal of affected protocols or functionality in their entirety).\n\n\nContinuous Integration and Continuous Delivery or Deployment (CI/CD)\nA set of practices in software development that aims to speed up and streamline the software development lifecycle. CI/CD is a key part of DevOps, which encourages collaboration between operations and development teams. Platforms such as Gitlab and Github are examples of CI/CD tools. \n\n\nDevSecOps (Development, Security, Operations)\nAn examination of the deployment strategies, security measures, and operational best practices to ensure a secure and efficient delivery and operation of the application. A practice in application security that involves introducing security earlier in the software development life cycle. It also expands the collaboration between development and operations teams to integrate security teams in the software delivery cycle and workflow of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).\n\n\nApplication Programming Interface (API)\nA way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. It simplifies software development by enabling applications to exchange data and functionality easily and more securely by providing a set of definitions and protocols to build and integrate application software.\n\n\nContent-Security-Policy (CSP)\nThe name of a HTTP response header that modern browsers use to enhance the security of the document (or web page). The Content-Security-Policy header allows you to restrict which resources (such as JavaScript, CSS, Images, etc.) can be loaded, and the URLs that they can be loaded from.\nOpen Web Application Security Project (OWASP)\nThe Open Web Application Security Project, or OWASP, is an international non-profit organization dedicated to web application security.\nOpenID Connect (OIDC)\nOpenID Connect (OIDC) is an open authentication protocol that works on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework. Targeted toward consumers, OIDC allows individuals to use single sign-on (SSO) to access relying party sites using OpenID Providers (OPs), such as an email provider or social network, to authenticate their identities. It provides the application or service with information about the user, the context of their authentication, and access to their profile information.",

Thus, there is a need to connect and work seamlessly with these pieces. When undergoing digital transformation initiatives it is imperative a solution is interoperable with other e-government solutions. \n\nLived Experiences \n\nConsidering the context of those implementing the solution is necessary. Lived experiences means including real-world workflows into your decision and implementation.\n\n Ex: Do you need to include digital literacy training to your onboarding for field workers? Do you expect field agents to use their personal phones to run the solution, or is hardware provided and how do you train offices on management of these hardware units? Is there 24hr connectivity for electricity and internet? \n\n\nUser Interface & User Experience Research & Testing (UI/UX)\n\nUser experience and user interface research and testing are critical for ensuring that digital products are intuitive, accessible, and effective, directly impacting user satisfaction and overall success. For digital transformation initiatives to be successful it is imperative one understands the actual workflow and contexts for the people you‚Äôre seeking to serve, including their digital lives and their capabilities (what technology is accessible to them? how often are they connected to the internet? how expensive is data? do local staff and those you are seeking to serve read and write? etc).\n\nKnowledge Redundancy \n\nHaving a community of contributors diversifies the expertise and opportunity for finding flaws while also compounding knowledge. It helps to have a decentralized learning approach with a couple people who can do the same thing so if a person leaves the work there isn‚Äôt a total gap in skill, knowledge or security.\n\nIterative Audits\n\nAudits are like a litmus test. Quickly highlighting vulnerabilities and the health of the solution as a whole. Technology is rapidly progressing and therefore, it‚Äôs necessary to regularly test the health of a system and look for exposed vulnerabilities, threats and opportunities for attacks. \nTip: Use a third-party auditor for unbiased results. \n\nHolistic Security \n\nThis means thinking about both how you design a solution to reduce harm, vulnerabilities regarding the code itself and the human factor‚Äìhow humans can use the solution for harm, hack it for sensitive information or engineer it to cause mass destruction. \n\nEngaged Team\n\nWe understand time and financial restrictions are often at play here, but working alongside a vendor or team that is responsive, communicates effectively, and engages in the process of fixing vulnerabilities or bugs, can help ensure success. Additionally, invest in training programs to equip employees with the necessary skills and knowledge. Engage them in the process to make them feel part of the transformation journey.\n\nOpen Source Technology\n\nWe firmly stand behind open source technology. It is transparent, collaborative, replicable and the community can contribute, making it a better solution for all.\n\nTip: Many DPGs are Open Source technologies by nature. \n\n\nCultural Shift\n\nFoster a culture that embraces change, innovation, and continuous improvement. Encourage collaboration, experimentation, and learning from failures to build a resilient and adaptable workforce.",

These projects were reviewed to assess their fitness for purpose, readiness for enhancement, maintainability, performance, and security.\nOur team has extensive experience working with, testing, building on, and deploying open-source projects and platforms. Behind these efforts are diverse teams with varying scales, experiences, qualities, reliability, visions, and commitments. Achieving a usable, dependable solution requires balancing creativity and experience, innovation, and reliability. Some developers can quickly demonstrate the feasibility of an idea but lack the follow-through to implement all necessary features. Conversely, others may be meticulous but inflexible in updating and improving their work. Additionally, building a solution involves decisions on whether to write everything from scratch or rely on and support a rich ecosystem of open-source modules, libraries, and services. There is no definitive answer, only a path forward shaped by specific requirements and expectations.\n\nLearn more about each partner assessment on the following pages: \nHolistic Assessment 1: ‚ÄúThe Turn-Key Solution‚Äù\nThis solution is ‚Äúturn key‚Äù in that it provides an out of the box, off-the-shelf ready for production set of features and capabilities.
