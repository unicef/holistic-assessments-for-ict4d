### CRVS Platforms, Key Findings for Practitioners&#x20;

This publication is for international development practitioners, both in programme and ICT divisions, who wish to understand and implement digitalised civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) programmes. These findings highlight a selection of CRVS platforms. The platforms were selected after due consultations with stakeholders on existing CRVS offerings. Conducted by UNICEF (via a 3rd party vendor), the review assessed the functional and non- functional aspects, as well as maturity, of CRVS products. The scope of this publication has limitations related to a) the exclusion of home-grown solutions and b) reliance on self-reporting by the vendors. This publication is relevant to UN, government, and NGO actors. It is intended to guide planning, budgeting, technology selection, and implementation strategies. It is also intended to support planning and programme operations design that are fit for purpose and uphold value, feasibility, and sustainability principles.

### Identifying and Addressing Risks to Children in Digitized Birth Registration Systems

Incorporating digital technologies in birth registration processes holds important potential for expanding the reach of registration and its benefits. This potential is beginning to be realised in a few countries: birth registration efforts through mobile phones have been linked to increasing registration rates in Uganda, and web-enabled birth registration in Uruguay allows newborns to receive their birth certificates before they leave the hospital.2 As countries expand their e-government capacities, digitised birth registration (DBR) may support governments in fulfilling their responsibility for civil registration and the provision of vital statistics.

Success stems from the ability of digital technology to streamline registration processes and improve data quality, overcoming both the geographic and bureaucratic barriers that often keep registration low. However, as with the introduction of any new technology, there are also potential dangers. These dangers have received little attention to date. To avoid them, implementing government agencies and their partners need to understand the potential

for harm related to DBR in general, and how to assess this potential in their specific country context. When the risks are mitigated, the full value and benefits of digital technologies in birth registration can be realised.

This document provides guidance on identifying and mitigating these risks for implementing government agencies and their partners operating in low- and middle-income countries. It expands on the model of DBR developed by Plan International as part of its Count Every Child initiative and within the context of strengthening civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems more broadly.
