# Overview

### Sharing Holistic Understanding

This collection of documents represents a set of perspectives, experiences, and guidelines on engaging with technology within the Information and Communications Technology for Development (ICT4D) space. In particular, the work focuses on the benefits and impacts of adopting free and open-source software that is secure and privacy-focused.&#x20;

We also focus our work through the four lenses of People, Process, Technology and Partners.

For our part in contributing to UNICEF's Digital Center of Excellent (DCoE) team focus on Electronic Civil Registration and Vital Statistic (eCRVS) solutions, we implemented a technical holistic audit program. The multi-staged approach includes an initial assessment based on published documentation and resources, meetings and interviews with program staff, an application architecture review, a source code security audit, a devsecops analysis, vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
