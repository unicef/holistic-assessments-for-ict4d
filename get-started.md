# Get Started

Threats and cybersecurity are always evolving. A holistic, iterative approach to auditing allows you to understand how good a system is at preserving the confidentiality of the people registered in a system. An approach to holistic auditing is relevant at several points within a Digital Transformation process, whether you’re starting a new project or are advising on an existing one.

If you are starting a new project...

* 👉 There are a variety of ways you can work! Consider evaluating the type of implementation partners you can work with. The [**Partner Audits**](partners/partner-audits/) section features four different types of partners: the [Turn-Key Solution](partners/partner-audits/audit-1-the-turn-key-solution.md), the [Open Platform](partners/partner-audits/audit-2-the-open-platform.md), the [Custom Software Development Kit](partners/partner-audits/audit-3-the-custom-software-development-kit.md) and the [Cloud Software-as-a-Service](partners/partner-audits/audit-4-the-cloud-software-as-a-service.md). Go to the **Partner Section** to learn about how different partners take different approaches to the same need.&#x20;
* 👉 Learn more about how you can get ahead of the game by partnering with solutions that have been audited or are already participating in iterative auditing cycles.

### <mark style="background-color:yellow;">🔍 Advising</mark>

If you are advising on an existing project...

* 👉 Check out the **Technology** **section** for [Management Best Practices](technology/beauty-and-flaws-of-architecture.md) and the [Threats to Success](people/threats-to-success.md) to find the areas to excel in as you work across multiple stakeholders on Digital Transformation processes.&#x20;
* 👉 Learn how holistic audits fit into your process. The [Holistic Audits Approach](process/holistic-audits-for-ict4d.md) section provides an overview of big picture processes to know about. Then, it takes you into the 5-step auditing framework.&#x20;
