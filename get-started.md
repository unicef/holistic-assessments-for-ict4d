# Get Started

Threats and cybersecurity are always evolving. A holistic, iterative approach to auditing allows you to understand how good a system is at preserving the confidentiality of the people registered in a system. An approach to holistic auditing is relevant at several points within a Digital Transformation process, whether youâ€™re starting a new project or are advising on an existing one.

### Visioning

If you are starting a new project...

* ðŸ‘‰ There are a variety of ways you can work! Consider evaluating the type of implementation partners you can work with. The [Evaluation Outcomes](partners/evaluation-outcomes/) section features four different types of partners: the Turn-Key Solution, the Open Platform, the Custom Software Development Kit and the Cloud Software-as-a-Service. Go here to learn about how different partners take different approaches to the same need.&#x20;
* ðŸ‘‰ Learn more about how you can get ahead of the game by partnering with solutions that have been audited or are already participating in iterative auditing cycles.
