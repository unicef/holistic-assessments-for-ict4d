# Evaluating Partners

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/pDPiwviyt4k" %}

Evaluations were conducted on four software projects that provide solutions in the realm of ICT4D. These projects were evaluated to assess their fitness for purpose, readiness for enhancement, maintainability, performance, and security.

Our team has extensive experience working with, testing, building on, and deploying open-source projects and platforms. Behind these efforts are diverse teams with varying scales, experiences, qualities, reliability, visions, and commitments. Achieving a usable, dependable solution requires balancing creativity and experience, innovation, and reliability. Some developers can quickly demonstrate the feasibility of an idea but lack the follow-through to implement all necessary features. Conversely, others may be meticulous but inflexible in updating and improving their work. Additionally, building a solution involves decisions on whether to write everything from scratch or rely on and support a rich ecosystem of open-source modules, libraries, and services. There is no definitive answer, only a path forward shaped by specific requirements and expectations.

### Evaluation 1: "The Turn-Key Solution"

We found the first solution we evaluted to be stable and ready for implementation. It has excellent documentation for implementers, is interoperable with many e-government solutions, and focuses on real-world workflows with a supportive team. The reliance on third-party dependencies is commonplace, and the choice of microservices makes for a flexible and extensible solution. While there are areas for improvement outlined in the document, they do not detract from the overall positive evaluation. As a relatively new entrant to the market, the product may not be as flexible or feature-rich as other solutions but benefits from a focused functionality, modern architecture, and well-run public open-source project. The concept of a single unified upstream codebase that can be improved and updated, then pushed out to downstream instances, is particularly attractive and beneficial for global deployment and maintenance.

During the first evaluation, we encountered vulnerabilities within the source code, the version of nodeJS it is built upon, and the security of deployment configurations. These issues were expected at this stage of the project. However, we were pleasantly surprised by how engaged and positive the team was in reviewing and addressing these issues. Fixes were implemented, nodeJS was updated, and deployment configurations were improved, indicating a healthy project ready to face real-world challenges. Despite these positive developments, we have concerns about improving the documentation to enable self-service deployment. To scale up effectively, it is essential to ensure the solution can be deployed in a repeatable, reliable, private, and secure manner by qualified individuals. The commitment to open, quality documentation is evident, but some confusing aspects need to be clarified, additional pieces provided, and improved scripts and deployment tools developed.
