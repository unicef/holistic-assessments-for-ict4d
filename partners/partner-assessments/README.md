# Partner Assessments

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/pDPiwviyt4k" %}

Holistic technical assessments were conducted on four software projects that provide solutions in the realm of ICT4D. These projects were reviewed to assess their fitness for purpose, readiness for enhancement, maintainability, performance, and security.

Our team has extensive experience working with, testing, building on, and deploying open-source projects and platforms. Behind these efforts are diverse teams with varying scales, experiences, qualities, reliability, visions, and commitments. **Achieving a usable, dependable solution requires balancing creativity and experience, innovation, and reliability.** Some developers can quickly demonstrate the feasibility of an idea but lack the follow-through to implement all necessary features. Conversely, others may be meticulous but inflexible in updating and improving their work. Additionally, building a solution involves decisions on whether to write everything from scratch or rely on and support a rich ecosystem of open-source modules, libraries, and services. There is no definitive answer, only a path forward shaped by specific requirements and expectations.
