_This solution is a "cloud software-as-a-service (SaaS)" in that is accessed, configured, and otherwise experienced as service running in a cloud environment, managed by the vendor themselves. The vendor handles not only any custom software development, customization, and integration, but also deployment and ongoing management in their cloud environment. This is the most hands-off solution, that can be appropriate for organizations without technical capacity, experiences, or resources._
