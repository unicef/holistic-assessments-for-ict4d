# Partner Assessments

<i>Most relevant for üí≠ [Visionaries](../../get-started.md#visionaries), üî• [Advisors](../../get-started.md#advising) and üîç [Technical Evaluators](../../get-started.md#evaluating)</i>

Holistic technical assessments were conducted on four software projects that provide solutions in the realm of ICT4D. These projects were reviewed to assess their fitness for purpose, readiness for enhancement, maintainability, performance, and security.

Our team has extensive experience working with, testing, building on, and deploying open-source projects and platforms. Behind these efforts are diverse teams with varying scales, experiences, qualities, reliability, visions, and commitments. **Achieving a usable, dependable solution requires balancing creativity and experience, innovation, and reliability.** Some developers can quickly demonstrate the feasibility of an idea but lack the follow-through to implement all necessary features. Conversely, others may be meticulous but inflexible in updating and improving their work. Additionally, building a solution involves decisions on whether to write everything from scratch or rely on and support a rich ecosystem of open-source modules, libraries, and services. There is no definitive answer, only a path forward shaped by specific requirements and expectations.

**Holistic Assessment 1:** ["The Turn-Key Solution"](the-turn-key-solution.md)

_This solution is "turn key" in that it provides an out of the box, off-the-shelf ready for production set of features and capabilities. The work to be done is in configuration and deployment, and not in customization or software development._

#### Holistic Assessment 2: ["The Open Platform"](the-open-platform.md)

_This solution is an "open platform" in that it provides a foundation for almost any kind of health and data application to be built upon. The work to be done is NOT ONLY configuration and deployment, but also customization and software development. However, there is also an ecosystem of third-party solutions and vendors that can be utilized to build a complete solution._

#### Holistic Assessment 3: ["The Custom Software Development Kit"](the-custom-software-development-kit.md)

_This solution is a "custom software development kit" in that it provides a collection of source code, developer libraries, example applications, and components on which to build. This is the most flexible solution and most appropriate for very specific, unique, or niche use cases. The work to be done is to design and develop a new application that integrates these core features. From there, it can be tested, audited, and otherwise prepared to be deployed into production._&#x20;

#### Holistic Assessment 4: ["The Cloud Software-as-a-Service"](the-cloud-software-as-a-service.md)

_This solution is a "cloud software-as-a-service (SaaS)" in that is accessed, configured, and otherwise experienced as service running in a cloud environment, managed by the vendor themselves. The vendor handles not only any custom software development, customization, and integration, but also deployment and ongoing management in their cloud environment. This is the most hands-off solution, that can be appropriate for organizations without technical capacity, experiences, or resources._
