# Audit Components, Steps and Timeline

## Components of a Holistic Audit&#x20;

The evaluation was designed to provide a comprehensive review of any solution through the following components:

### 1. Initial Assessment of Solution, Assets, and Documentation

Meet with and interview the product team, receive a typical walkthrough demonstration of the system, gather all available documentation, reports, source code, tools, and complete an overall review of the “fitness” of the solution and readiness for proceeding through the rest of the audit process

### 2. Source Code Security Audit

Uncover flaws in the application (bugs, security weaknesses, extensibility, maintainability...), and evaluate the readiness of the source code for being enhanced by a third party

### 3. Application Architecture Audit

Review the structure of the application, on how the different components, database, APIs, and third-party libraries interact within the code under the lens of maintainability, performance at scale, re-usability, flexibility, cyber security, and data privacy.&#x20;

### 4. Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Scan

Evaluate the holistic approach in terms of cyber security, through active and passive security scanning of vulnerabilities, manual penetration testing, security policies analysis, Analysis of history of public vulnerabilities, analysis of security guidelines/documentation (including resilience and recovery recommendations), and more.

### 5. DevSecOps Analysis

Software development operation best practices and from the operations management from a system administration perspective, and provide guidance for keeping in production a solution in a stable, updated, and secure perspective.

## Audit Timeline

Below is a potential step-by-step timeline that incorporoates the components from above, with an estimate of days to complete, along with guidance about following up with the vendor/partner/solutions team.

**Step 1: Request Access to Source Code, Design Documents (10 days)**

* Begin our deep dive into publicly available documentation and resources (website, githubs, case studies, install guides, etc)

**Step 2: Initial Assessment Results (5 days)**

* A narrative report on background information and history, which includes a Threat & Risk Assessment portion.&#x20;
* _Share Evaluation & Report any issues to vendor_

**Step 3: Source Code Security Audit (15 days)**

* _Share Evaluation & Report any issues to vendor_

**Step 4: Application Architecture Audit (10 days)**

* _Share Evaluation & Report any issues to vendor_&#x20;

**Step 5: Penetration Testing Audit (10 days)**

* _Share Evaluation & Report any issues to vendor_&#x20;
  * Schedule a call to discuss severe issues if necessary&#x20;

**Step 6: DevSecOps Analysis (15 days)**

* _Share Evaluation & Report any issues to vendor_&#x20;

**Step 7: Report of Findings and Recommendations (10 days)**

* _Share Evaluation & Report any issues to vendor_&#x20;

**Step 8: Review Vendor Updates**

* 8 weeks after sharing of initial report the Evaluator will review any fixed issues and remaining timeline of the vendor, and share a follow-on report of statuses and final assessment.
