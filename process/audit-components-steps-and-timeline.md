# Audit Components, Steps and Timeline

This process follows a set of tasks and engagements that include the vendor to foster transparency and accuracy of produced and shared findings. Many of these tasks happen in parallel. It begins with introductions and laying a foundation of trust.&#x20;

* Initial introduction between auditors, solution team, and other stakeholders
* Onboarding call with the vendor and demo of the solution
* Create an established communications channel and share asset request list with vendor
  * _Tip: It is helpful to choose a communication channel that already exists in the vendor workflow to ease any burden of communication_
* &#x20;Create a file sharing service folder for ease of document uploading and sharing of Assets and any additional resources the vendor deem useful (case studies, security audits, SBOM, independent reports, etc.).

Furthermore, is important to engage with vendors frequently regarding any discovered vulnerabilities or bugs. After each step in the process we share an evaluation update with the vendor and UNICEF and allow feedback so the process can be iterative and accurately reflect a relevant and up-to-date solution.&#x20;

For high or severe level vulnerabilities, the disclosure approach includes:&#x20;

* Ethically disclose vulnerabilities or bugs to vendors&#x20;
  * After each Step (Assessment/Audit), disclose any vulnerabilities or bugs found to the vendor through an agreed upon communication channel
* Handle all sensitive communications through a secure, confidential manner agreed upon by the vendor and auditor
* Negotiate with vendors regarding the complexity of a fix and timeline
* Based on the complexity, determine how and when to update the evaluation report accordingly (ie- a vulnerability is disclosed, but not fixed, a fix is in process, a resulting evaluation of a fix)

### Audit Components

The evaluation was designed to provide a comprehensive review of any solution through the following components

#### Initial Assessment of Solution, Assets, and Documentation

Meet with and interview the product team, receive a typical walkthrough demonstration of the system, gather all available documentation, reports, source code, tools, and complete an overall review of the “fitness” of the solution and readiness for proceeding through the rest of the audit process

#### Source Code Security Audit

Uncover flaws in the application (bugs, security weaknesses, extensibility, maintainability...), and evaluate the readiness of the source code for being enhanced by a third party

#### Application Architecture Audit

Review the structure of the application, on how the different components, database, APIs, and third-party libraries interact within the code under the lens of maintainability, performance at scale, re-usability, flexibility, cyber security, and data privacy.&#x20;

#### Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Scan

Evaluate the holistic approach in terms of cyber security, through active and passive security scanning of vulnerabilities, manual penetration testing, security policies analysis, Analysis of history of public vulnerabilities, analysis of security guidelines/documentation (including resilience and recovery recommendations), and more.

#### DevSecOps Analysis

Software development operation best practices and from the operations management from a system administration perspective, and provide guidance for keeping in production a solution in a stable, updated, and secure perspective.

## Audit Steps

**Step 1: Request Access to Source Code, Design Documents (10 days)**

* Begin our deep dive into publicly available documentation and resources (website, githubs, case studies, install guides, etc)

**Step 2: Initial Assessment Results (5 days)**

* A narrative report on background information and history, which includes a Threat & Risk Assessment portion.&#x20;
* _Share Evaluation & Report any issues to vendor_

**Step 3: Source Code Security Audit (15 days)**

* _Share Evaluation & Report any issues to vendor_

**Step 4: Application Architecture Audit (10 days)**

* _Share Evaluation & Report any issues to vendor_&#x20;

**Step 5: Penetration Testing Audit (10 days)**

* _Share Evaluation & Report any issues to vendor_&#x20;
  * Schedule a call to discuss severe issues if necessary&#x20;

**Step 6: DevSecOps Analysis (15 days)**

* _Share Evaluation & Report any issues to vendor_&#x20;

**Step 7: Report of fFndings and Recommendations (10 days)**

* _Share Evaluation & Report any issues to vendor_&#x20;

**Step 8: Review Vendor Updates**

* 8 weeks after sharing of initial report the Evaluator will review any fixed issues and remaining timeline of the vendor, and share a follow-on report of statuses and final assessment.
