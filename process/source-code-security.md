# Source Code Security

A source code security audit is a crucial step in ensuring that a web and mobile application is secure and protected from potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. The following is a specification of a source code security audit for a web and mobile application:

### Scope

The audit should cover all components of the application, including the server-side code, client-side code, and any third-party libraries or plugins used.

### Objective

The objective of the audit is to identify potential security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers, such as injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), authentication and authorization issues, and data leakage.

### Methodology

The audit should follow a methodology that includes both manual and automated testing, such as code review, static analysis, and penetration testing. The methodology should be comprehensive and cover all possible attack vectors.

### Tools

The auditor should use a variety of tools to perform the audit, including automated scanners, integrated cloud testing tools and service (Astra, Intruder), such as Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP, as well as manual testing tools like Postman, cURL, or browser extensions.

### Reporting

The auditor should provide a detailed report that outlines the findings and recommendations for fixing any identified security issues. The report should include a list of vulnerabilities, their severity, and recommendations for remediation.

### Compliance

The audit should ensure that the application complies with relevant security standards and best practices, such as OWASP Top 10, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA.

### Timeline

The audit should be completed within a reasonable timeframe, with a minimum of two weeks to allow for thorough testing and analysis of the source code.

### Follow-up

After the audit is completed, it is important to follow up with the development team to ensure that the recommended fixes have been implemented and that the application is now secure. It is also recommended to conduct periodic security audits to stay ahead of emerging threats and to maintain the security of the application over time.\
