# DevSecOps Checklist

<i>Most relevant for üîç [Technical Evaluators](../../../get-started.md#technical-evaluators)</i>

Earlier in this guide, the process for auditing [Development, Security and Operations](../devsecops.md) ("DevSecOps") practices was reviewed. Through the results of applying this [holistic assessment process](../../holistic-audits-for-ict4d.md) to the [technical reviews that were completed](../../../partners/partner-assessments/), a set of common opportunities where best practices can be improved were uncovered. Some of these may seem simple or obvious, however they were still opportunities to improve in these areas in all the assessments that were completed.

* [ ] <mark class="yellow-bg">**Implement secure deployment practices**</mark> \
  Ensure secure deployment practices, such as using encrypted connections, restricting access to sensitive data, and implementing strong authentication mechanisms.\

* [ ] <mark class="yellow-bg">**Prioritize traffic protection**</mark>\
  Implement robust security measures to protect against traffic manipulation and eavesdropping, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption and intrusion detection systems.\

* [ ] <mark class="yellow-bg">**Develop comprehensive test plans**</mark>\
  Create comprehensive test plans that cover various scenarios and use automated testing tools to thoroughly evaluate the system's functionality and performance.\

* [ ] <mark class="yellow-bg">**Eliminate hard-coded credentials**</mark>\
  Implement secure credential management practices, such as using secrets management tools and rotating credentials regularly.\

* [ ] <mark class="yellow-bg">**Protect against supply chain attacks**</mark>\
  Implement measures to protect against supply chain attacks, such as verifying the integrity of software updates and using a trusted software repository.\

* [ ] <mark class="yellow-bg">**Secure database access and authentication**</mark>\
  Implement secure database access controls, such as role-based access control and input validation, and ensure strong authentication mechanisms for authentication services.\

* [ ] <mark class="yellow-bg">**Improve exception logging**</mark>\
  Implement robust exception logging to capture and analyze errors, facilitating proactive problem resolution and enhancing system reliability.\

* [ ] <mark class="yellow-bg">**Prioritize input sanitization**</mark>\
  Implement rigorous input sanitization techniques to prevent malicious inputs from exploiting vulnerabilities and ensure the integrity of the system.
