# Holistic Audits for ICT4D

Throughout our work, we will be utilizing different strategies, techniques, and methodologies, and reflect upon how the solution providers themselves used this methodologies.&#x20;

#### Needs Assessment

Needs Assessment is a process of identifying and analyzing the needs of a specific group of users or stakeholders in order to determine the best course of action to meet those needs. In the context of software development, a needs assessment is an important part of the planning phase of the project. It involves gathering and analyzing data about the users or stakeholders who will be using the software, as well as their needs and requirements.

#### Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is a process of identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing the potential security threats and vulnerabilities in a software system. It is an important part of the software development process because it helps to ensure that the software is designed and implemented in a way that is secure and resistant to attacks.

#### Risk Mitigation

Risk mitigation is the process of identifying, analyzing, and taking steps to reduce or eliminate risks in a software development project. It is an important part of the software development process because it helps to ensure that the project is delivered on time, within budget, and with a high level of quality.

#### Harm Reducation

Harm reduction is a public health approach that focuses on reducing the negative consequences associated with risky behaviors, rather than attempting to eliminate the behaviors themselves. In the context of software development, harm reduction may refer to the process of designing and implementing software in a way that minimizes the potential for harm to users or stakeholders.
