#### Software Bill Of Materials

One area to discuss with closed-source vendors, is if they are able to product a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). This can be a way they can share their technical building blocks, without having to expose their intellectual property. Also, while they mention penetration testing, we should learn more about their “secure by design” methods. This is where standards related to OWASP and SAST tools can play a role - if they adopt these themselves, and can produce the report outputs, then we may not need to direct analyze their source code.
