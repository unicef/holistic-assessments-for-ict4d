# Threat Modeling and Mitigations

<i>Most relevant for üî• [Advisors](../get-started.md#advisors) and üîç [Technical Evaluators](../get-started.md#technical-evaluators)</i>

As discussed in the [introduction to this section](holistic-audits-for-ict4d.md), threat modeling is a process of identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing the potential security threats and vulnerabilities in a software system. In response to those threats, risk mitigation offers a process of designing, implementing, and otherwise taking steps to reduce or eliminate identified risks (threats and vulnerabilities!) in a software development project or technology solution.

#### A Wide Variety of Approaches

While we took a specific approach to this work in our technical assessments, there is a long history of diverse approaches to understanding threat and risk. Here are a few outside links to broader, useful resources on the web.&#x20;

* ["Threat Modeling for Measurement and Analytics"](https://docs.cleaninsights.org/docs/threat-modeling/) - a [15 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6ac3WoogA) and [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RsikxjM9SxLkEK68WT4sgywA68LeL2m3o9T37LcjRCY/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Sample Threat Model

Below is an example of a threat modeling process performed on a [recently reviewed solution](../partners/partner-assessments/). The Threat, Likelihood, Impact, and Severity columns listed below are in reference to the world, and specific places where solutions are implemented, and not specific to the vendor, platform, or solution itself. This gives the reader an idea of what kind of mitigations could be put in place for a solution.

Likelihoods range from <mark class="blue">Unlikely</mark> to <mark style="color:red;">Likely</mark>, while Severity can be <mark class="blue">Minor</mark> to <mark style="color:red;">Critical</mark>.\
