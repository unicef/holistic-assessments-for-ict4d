# Threat and Risk Assessment

Below is an example of an assessment performed on a recently evaluated solution.

\
The Threat, Likelihood, Impact, and Severity columns listed below are in reference to the world, and specific places where CRVS solutions are implemented, and not specific to the vendor, platform, or solution itself. In addition, this is a general assessment, to give the reader an idea of what Mitigations are in place for this specific solution.

\* Ultimately, deployment and operational responsibilities are outside of the scope of the DHIS2 software project, though based on the mitigations listed, they do the best they can to guide and support the process
