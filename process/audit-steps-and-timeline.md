# Audit Steps and Timeline

Our iterative evaluation approach follows a set of tasks and engagements that include the vendor to foster transparency and accuracy of produced and shared findings. Many of these tasks happen in parallel. We begin with introductions and laying a foundation of trust.&#x20;

* Initial introduction email (our PM Lead introduces us to the vendor contact)
* Schedule a kickoff call with the vendor and demo of the solution when possible
* Create an established communications channel and share asset request list with vendor
  * _Tip: It is helpful to choose a communication channel that already exists in the vendor workflow to ease any burden of communication_
* &#x20;Create a shared google drive folder for ease of document uploading and sharing of Assets and any additional resources the vendor deem useful (case studies, security audits, SBOM, independent reports, etc.).

Furthermore, is important to us that we engage with vendors regarding found vulnerabilities or bugs. After each step in the process we share an evaluation update with the vendor and UNICEF and allow feedback so the process can be iterative and accurately reflect a relevant and up-to-date solution.&#x20;

Our disclosure approach includes:&#x20;

* Ethically disclose vulnerabilities or bugs to vendors&#x20;
  * After each Step (Assessment/Audit), Guardian Project will disclose any vulnerabilities or bugs found to the vendor through an agreed upon communication channel (email, slack, Signal, Github or issue tracker).
  * This will be done in a secure, confidential manner agreed upon by the vendor and auditor (Guardian Project)
* Negotiate with vendors regarding the complexity of a fix and timeline
* Based on the complexity, determine how Guardian Project will update their evaluation report accordingly (ie- a vulnerability is disclosed, but not fixed, a fix is in process, a resulting evaluation of a fix)



## Audit Steps

* **Step 1: Request Access to Source Code, Design Documents (10 days)**
  * Begin our deep dive into publicly available documentation and resources (website, githubs, case studies, install guides, etc)
* **Step 2: Initial Assessment Results (5 days)**
  * A narrative report on background information and history, which includes a Threat & Risk Assessment portion.&#x20;
  * _Share Evaluation & Report any issues to vendor_
* **Step 3: Source Code Security Audit (15 days)**
  * _Share Evaluation & Report any issues to vendor_
* **Step 4: Application Architecture Audit (10 days)**
  * _Share Evaluation & Report any issues to vendor_&#x20;
* **Step 5: Penetration Testing Audit (10 days)**
  * _Share Evaluation & Report any issues to vendor_&#x20;
    * Schedule a call to discuss severe issues if necessary&#x20;
* **Step 6: DevSecOps Analysis (15 days)**
  * _Share Evaluation & Report any issues to vendor_&#x20;
* **Step 7: Report of fFndings and Recommendations (10 days)**
  * _Share Evaluation & Report any issues to vendor_&#x20;
* **Step 8: Review Vendor Updates**
  * 8 weeks after sharing of initial report the Evaluator will review any fixed issues and remaining timeline of the vendor, and share a follow-on report of statuses and final assessment.

_Note: Some of these Steps may run in parallel depending upon availability of resources and status of dependencies._

_Note: If the vendor for some reason determines a fix isnâ€™t necessary and Guardian Project feels it is a severe issue, they have a moral obligation to then take action. This action step will be shared with UNICEF and the vendor prior to action._&#x20;
