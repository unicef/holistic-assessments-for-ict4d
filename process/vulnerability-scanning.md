### Scanning at Runtime

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a type of security testing that focuses on the dynamic analysis of the application while it is running. DAST testing involves analyzing the behavior of the application during runtime to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. DAST tools typically simulate a user interacting with the application, sending various inputs to the system to see how it responds. DAST testing is particularly useful for identifying vulnerabilities related to input validation, authentication, and authorization.

DAST testing is focused on identifying vulnerabilities that can be discovered by analyzing the running application. DAST tools scan the application for vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQL injection, and CSRF attacks, and typically use a black-box approach where they have no knowledge of the application's internal workings. DAST tools can be used to identify a wide range of vulnerabilities, but they may miss some issues that can only be identified through manual testing or other specialized testing techniques.
