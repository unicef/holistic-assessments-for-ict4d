#### Penetration and Dynamic Application Security Testing

Penetration Testing, also known as "pen testing," is a form of security testing that involves simulating a real-world attack on a system to identify vulnerabilities and potential exploits. The goal of penetration testing is to assess the security posture of a web and mobile application and to identify any weaknesses that could be exploited by an attacker. The penetration tester attempts to exploit vulnerabilities, typically using a combination of automated and manual techniques, to gain access to sensitive data or functionality within the application. The testing is typically conducted in a controlled environment, such as a test or staging environment, to prevent any unintended impact on the production system.

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a type of security testing that focuses on the dynamic analysis of the application while it is running. DAST testing involves analyzing the behavior of the application during runtime to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. DAST tools typically simulate a user interacting with the application, sending various inputs to the system to see how it responds. DAST testing is particularly useful for identifying vulnerabilities related to input validation, authentication, and authorization.

During a penetration testing engagement, the tester attempts to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the application, using a range of techniques including vulnerability scanning, manual testing, and social engineering. The penetration tester attempts to gain access to the system, escalate privileges, and access sensitive data or functionality within the application. The testing can be performed from various perspectives, such as an external attacker or an insider threat, to identify vulnerabilities from different angles.

\


On the other hand, DAST testing is focused on identifying vulnerabilities that can be discovered by analyzing the running application. DAST tools scan the application for vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQL injection, and CSRF attacks, and typically use a black-box approach where they have no knowledge of the application's internal workings. DAST tools can be used to identify a wide range of vulnerabilities, but they may miss some issues that can only be identified through manual testing or other specialized testing techniques.

\


In conclusion, penetration testing and DAST testing are both important types of security testing for web and mobile applications. Penetration testing simulates a real-world attack on the system to identify vulnerabilities and potential exploits, while DAST testing analyzes the behavior of the application during runtime to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. By combining both types of testing, an organization can identify and remediate vulnerabilities in their applications, improving the overall security posture of their systems.
