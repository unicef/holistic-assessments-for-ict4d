# Penetration Testing

Penetration Testing, also known as "pen testing," is a form of security testing that involves simulating a real-world attack on a system to identify vulnerabilities and potential exploits. The goal of penetration testing is to assess the security posture of a web and mobile application and to identify any weaknesses that could be exploited by an attacker. The penetration tester attempts to exploit vulnerabilities, typically using a combination of automated and manual techniques, to gain access to sensitive data or functionality within the application. The testing is typically conducted in a controlled environment, such as a test or staging environment, to prevent any unintended impact on the production system.

During a penetration testing engagement, the tester attempts to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the application, using a range of techniques including vulnerability scanning, manual testing, and social engineering. The penetration tester attempts to gain access to the system, escalate privileges, and access sensitive data or functionality within the application. The testing can be performed from various perspectives, such as an external attacker or an insider threat, to identify vulnerabilities from different angles.
