# Operational Excellence

Earlier in this guide, the process for auditing [Development, Security and Operations](../process/audit-components-steps-and-timeline/devsecops.md) ("DevSecOps") practices was reviewed. Through the results of applying this [holistic audit process](../process/holistic-audits-for-ict4d.md) in the [evaluations that were completed](../partners/evaluations-outcomes.md), a list of opportunities where best practices can be improved were compiled.

### **Implement secure deployment practices**

Ensure secure deployment practices, such as using encrypted connections, restricting access to sensitive data, and implementing strong authentication mechanisms.

### **Prioritize traffic protection**

Implement robust security measures to protect against traffic manipulation and eavesdropping, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption and intrusion detection systems.

### **Develop comprehensive test plans**

Create comprehensive test plans that cover various scenarios and use automated testing tools to thoroughly evaluate the system's functionality and performance.

### **Eliminate hard-coded credentials**

Implement secure credential management practices, such as using secrets management tools and rotating credentials regularly.

### **Protect against supply chain attacks**

Implement measures to protect against supply chain attacks, such as verifying the integrity of software updates and using a trusted software repository.

### **Address database access and authentication service vulnerabilities**

Implement secure database access controls, such as role-based access control and input validation, and ensure strong authentication mechanisms for authentication services.

### **Improve exception logging**

Implement robust exception logging to capture and analyze errors, facilitating proactive problem resolution and enhancing system reliability.

### **Prioritize input sanitization**

Implement rigorous input sanitization techniques to prevent malicious inputs from exploiting vulnerabilities and ensure the integrity of the system.
