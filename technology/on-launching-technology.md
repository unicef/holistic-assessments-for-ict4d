# Our Technical Findings

{% hint style="success" %}
Most relevant for ðŸ’­ [Visionaries](../get-started.md#visioning) and ðŸ”¥ [Advisors](../get-started.md#advising)
{% endhint %}

Technical assessments were conducted on four software projects that provide solutions in the realm of ICT4D. These projects were reviewed to assess their fitness for purpose, readiness for enhancement, maintainability, performance, and security.

The technical assessments involved a comprehensive review of the projects' documentation, source code, and deployment environments. Security audits were conducted to uncover vulnerabilities, and penetration testing was performed to assess the systems' resilience against cyberattacks. The assessments also examined the projects' software development practices, including testing procedures and DevSecOps methodologies.

Based on the findings, several recommendations were made to improve the security and reliability of the projects. These recommendations included implementing secure deployment practices, prioritizing traffic protection, developing comprehensive test plans, eliminating hard-coded credentials, and protecting against supply chain attacks. Additionally, recommendations were made to address specific vulnerabilities identified during the assessments, such as improving exception logging and prioritizing input sanitization.

## <mark style="background-color:yellow;">In the following sections, we will provide generalized versions of the recommendations made to these projects, that we feel are widely applicable when launching any ICT4D implementation.</mark>
