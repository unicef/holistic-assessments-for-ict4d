In recent years, the Digital Transformation of [Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS)](https://www.who.int/data/data-collection-tools/civil-registration-and-vital-statistics-\(crvs\)) has emerged as a critical agenda item for [UNICEF](https://data.unicef.org/crvs/) and its partners worldwide. Where manual systems can be inaccurate and difficult to access, digital systems present the opportunity to streamline the process and improve data integrity and security. With [Digital Transformation](https://www.unicef.org/eap/what-we-do/digital-transformation) as a priority, UNICEF has the opportunity to accelerate its mission to protect the wellbeing and rights of children worldwide.

## **“Around the world, over 1 billion people are invisible, living without a legal identity.”**

In order to undergo Digital Transformation in any sector, partnerships with governments, civil society groups, academia, non-governmental organizations, private sector entities, and communities remain central to UNICEF’s approach. They create a network to address the complex challenges of Digital Transformation: both social and technical.&#x20;

This network of stakeholders play a vital role in the success of Digital Transformation. This report looks through the lens of CRVS projects to reflect how the interactions between stakeholders affects success. It explores:

* Who is involved
* Experiences with government; and
* Threats to success

### Key Findings

1. In considering holistic security, we must broaden our scope beyond system vulnerabilities and cybersecurity threats.&#x20;
2. We must also acknowledge and address the threats introduced by the people and processes involved.
3. Regardless of the experience with a government to undergo Digital Transformation, challenges persist
   1. missing expertise specifically in early stages and project leadership
   2. knowledge gaps among implementing teams
   3. turnover in government employees and contractors.

### Research Background

This study included five conversations with a variety of stakeholders who have been involved in engagements to implement digital systems or to advise on their expansion. It represents the perspectives of UNICEF staff in regional and country offices who are coordinating and advising governments on digital components of programs. It involved in-depth conversations with a tech solution coordinator who closely works on implementations of CRVS solutions with several governments both with and without UNICEF’s involvement. Last, but certainly not least, it brings a critical perspective on what it means to localize technology within a country or group of people; and specifically women.
