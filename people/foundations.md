# Foundations

In order to undergo Digital Transformation in any sector, partnerships with governments, civil society groups, academia, non-governmental organizations, private sector entities, and communities remain central to UNICEF’s approach. They create a network to address the complex challenges of Digital Transformation: both social and technical. This network of stakeholders play a vital role in the success of Digital Transformation.&#x20;



**Government**

Typically the government takes the lead and is the primary decision maker. They are supported by sponsors, advisors, and technical experts who offer guidance, financial support, and essential services. Different ministries and offices within a government are involved in Digital Transformation projects.



**UNICEF Advisors**

Typical way UNICEF advises:

> “I was there to interface between the government and also the vendor. Then sometimes we will bring our regional colleagues, and we have a discussion about all of the system requirements.” — Country Programme Participant

Other Advisors may also be involved.



**Technology Implementers**

The composition of stakeholders involved in the technology implementation will vary depending on the government’s approach (ie. building in-house or using outside products and services) and subsequently, their selection of platforms and vendors. For example, if a government is building a system from scratch, they may hire a 3rd party software development team to build it, then move the project to their in-house development team to maintain. Other governments may choose to use a digital public good, like OpenCRVS or DHIS2. If this is their starting point, their process and partners will look very different. &#x20;

Technology stakeholders that may be involved include:

* Internal development teams
* 3rd party software companies
* Implementation coordinator for the technology platform
* Technology platform’s community of developers&#x20;
* System integrator&#x20;
* Entry-level developers



**Field and Office Workers**&#x20;

The individuals responsible for recording the registrations and vital statistics are key stakeholders. These people are unique in each country, but can include nurses, community health workers and tribal chiefs.\


**Citizens**

Citizens are a key stakeholder, as the success of a programme is dependent on their involvement. Among those responsible for registration are parents of newborns, immigrants, urban dwellers, as well as families and individuals residing in remote villages or mountainous regions.
