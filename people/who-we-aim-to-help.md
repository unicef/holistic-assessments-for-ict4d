# Who We Aim to Help

This work was commissioned by the Digital Center of Excellence (DCoE) at UNICEF.  In the context of digital transformation, stakeholders encompass a spectrum of actors, including government, advisors and sponsors, technology implementers, field and office workers, and citizens.

The choice a government makes about which technology solution or approach to take influences who is involved, specifically for technology implementation. Though, it can also affect who is involved in the early stages of conceptualizing the system. Throughout this work it is noted that a range of stakeholders are or should be involved in a Digital Transformation process.

Our guides have a focused lens of assisting the specific audiences through the process of digital transformation initiatives: &#x20;

* Procurement specialist, works to make sure any RFP process is fair and equal
* Different offices with T4D specialists that participate in different projects
* Regional T4D (technologists for development) that have expertise in the region, and also a sales role in country offices
